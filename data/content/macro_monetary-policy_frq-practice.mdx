Assume that the economy of Inaba is currently at long run equilibrium. However, a drop in consumer confidence leads to the economy entering a recession.

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>Draw a correctly labeled supply and demand graph showing the economy at equilibrium.</li>
  <li>Draw and label the resulting shift from the drop in consumer confidence.</li>
  <li>The government decides to pursue fiscal policy. Given a .8 MPC, how much money would the government have to cut in taxes in order to counter a 800 million dollar deficit?</li>
  <li>Draw a correctly labelled loanable funds graph, showing the shift that would occur from this increased government spending</li>
  <li>How will the change in the interest rate affect the overall economy of Inaba?</li>

Assume that the United States economy is operating below full employment.
<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    Draw a correctly labeled graph of long-run aggregate supply, short-run aggregate supply, and aggregate
    demand, and show each of the following.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Current equilibrium output and price level, labeled as $Y_1$ and $PL_1$
      </li>
      <li>
        Full-employment output, labeled as $Y_f$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume that the Federal Reserve targets a new federal funds rate to reach full employment. Should the
    Federal Reserve target a higher or lower federal funds rate?
  </li>
  <li>
    Given the Federal Reserve action you identified in part (b), draw a correctly labeled graph of the money
    market and show the effect on the nominal interest rate.
  </li>
  <li>
    The policy makers pursue a fiscal policy rather than the monetary policy in part (b). Assume that the
    marginal propensity to consume is 0.8 and the value of the recessionary gap is $300 billion.
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the government changes its spending without changing taxes to eliminate the recessionary gap,
        calculate the minimum required change in government spending.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the government changes taxes without changing government spending to eliminate the recessionary
        gap, will the minimum required change in taxes be greater than, smaller than, or equal to the minimum
        required change in government spending in part (d)(i) ? Explain.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume the government lowers income tax rates to eliminate the recessionary gap. Will each of the
    following increase, decrease, or stay the same?
    <ol>
      <li>
        Aggregate demand. Explain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Long-run aggregate supply. Explain.

    <li> 
      +1 for stating that real GDP will increase in the short run and explaining that a decrease in the real interest rate will increase interest-sensitive spending (consumer, investment, and exports)
    </li>
    <li> 
      +1 for explaining that the tax multiplier ($\frac{mpc}{mps} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4$) is smaller than
      the government spending multiplier ($\frac{1}{mps} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5$) because part of the initial increase in
      disposable income caused by the decrease in income tax will be saved rather than spent

    <li>
      +1 for stating that aggregate demand will increase and for explaining that lower
      income tax rates will increase disposable income and/or consumption and investment.

    The next point has 3 answers:

    <li>
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will stay the same because lowering
      income taxes will increase consumption and/or investment, or there is no change in inputs
    </li>

    **OR**

    <li> 
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will increase in the long run because
      lowering taxes will increase savings and investment in physical capital, or because of increased
      incentives to work.
    </li>

    **OR**

    <li>
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will decrease in the long run
      because lowering taxes leads to a crowding out of private investment.
