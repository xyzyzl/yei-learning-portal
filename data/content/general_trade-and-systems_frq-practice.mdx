Japan can choose to produce stoves and cars, as shown in the production possibilities
frontier below.

<ol className="alpha-list-mdx">
  <li>
    Give the maximum number of cars that can currently be made if 4 stoves are
    produced, and explain why. Assume the production possibilities frontier is
    perfectly linear.
  </li>
  <li>
    The marginal cost for Taiwan between stoves and cars is 3 cars per stove.
    Assuming Japan and Taiwan want to trade, what should Japan specialize in
    producing? Explain.
